        <h2>World Environment Day</h2>
          <p>Led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and held annually on 5 June since 1973, World Environment Day is the largest global platform for environmental public outreach and is celebrated by millions of people across the world. In 2023, it is hosted by Côte D'Ivoire.</p>

        <h2>Chipko movement</h2>
          <p>The Chipko movement was a non-violent agitation in 1973 that was aimed at protection and conservation of trees, but, perhaps, it is best remembered for the collective mobilisation of women for the cause of preserving forests, which also brought about a change in attitude regarding their own status in society. The uprising against the felling of trees and maintaining the ecological balance originated in Uttar Pradesh’s Chamoli district (now Uttarakhand) in 1973 and in no time spilled onto other states in north India. The name of the movement ‘chipko’ comes from the word ’embrace’, as the villagers hugged the trees and encirled them to prevent being hacked.The Chipko movement was a non-violent agitation in 1973 that was aimed at protection and conservation of trees, but, perhaps, it is best remembered for the collective mobilisation of women for the cause of preserving forests, which also brought about a change in attitude regarding their own status in society.

            <h2>Environment Protection Act (EPA)</h2>
          <p> This amendment also added new Directive Principles of State Policy, one of which was Article 48A, which directed the State to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard forests and wildlife.

These developments were a result of the United Nations Conference on Human Environment, held in Stockholm in 1972. First, the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 was enacted. Then, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 was passed, followed by the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981. Then in 1986, the EPA was passed by the Parliament, in the wake of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, which occurred on Dec 2, 1984.</p>

            <h2> Simple Things You Can Do to Help Protect the Earth</h2>
          <p>Reduce, reuse, and recycle. Cut down on what you throw away. Follow the three "R's" to conserve natural resources and landfill space.
Volunteer. Volunteer for cleanups in your community. You can get involved in protecting your watershed, too.
Educate. When you further your own education, you can help others understand the importance and value of our natural resources.
Conserve water. The less water you use, the less runoff and wastewater that eventually end up in the ocean.
Choose sustainable. Learn how to make smart seafood choices at www.fishwatch.gov.
Shop wisely. Buy less plastic and bring a reusable shopping bag.
Use long-lasting light bulbs. Energy efficient light bulbs reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Also flip the light switch off when you leave the room!
Plant a tree. Trees provide food and oxygen. They help save energy, clean the air, and help combat climate change.
Don't send chemicals into our waterways. Choose non-toxic chemicals in the home and office.</p>

           <h2> Narmada Bachao Andolan</h2>
          <p> Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA, Hindi: नर्मदा बचाओ आंदोलन, 'Save the Narmada River Movement') is an Indian social movement spearheaded by native tribals (adivasis), farmers, environmentalists and human rights activists against a number of large dam projects across the Narmada River, which flows through the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is one of the biggest dams on the river and was one of the first focal points of the movement. It is part of the Narmada Dam Project, whose main aim is to provide irrigation and electricity to people of the above states.

The mode of campaign under NBA includes court actions, hunger strikes, rallies and gathering support from notable film and art personalities. The NBA, with its leading spokespersons Medha Patkar and Baba Amte, received the Right Livelihood Award in 1991.</p>
